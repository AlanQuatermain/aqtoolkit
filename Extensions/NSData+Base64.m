// implementation for base64 comes from OmniFoundation. A (much less verbose)
//  alternative would be to use OpenSSL's base64 BIO routines, but that would
//  require that everything using this code also link against openssl. Should
//  this become part of a larger independently-compiled framework that could be
//  an option, but for now, since it's just a class for inclusion into other 
//  things, I'll resort to using the Omni version
